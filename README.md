## Analysis of Population Age 0-14, 15-64, and 65 or over


### Two Ways to Run the Project
1.  index.html
2.  scenes.html?years=1990

### Messaging
Giving data of the global population ages 0-14, 15-64, and 65 or over from 1960 to 2021. My project includes three scenes and a main page, totally. Year 1990, 2010, and 2021 as parameters are used to filter out the datapoints to change states in each scene so that the users can investigate different visualization in each scene.

### Narrative Structure
The narrative visualization is structured by an interactive slideshow. Three scenes can be leaded by the main page into the narrative visualization, then the users can either follow the order of scenes or select one of scenes that they might interest to read or investigate different visualization.

### Visual Structure
The datapoints are filtered out by year parameters to change states that highlights important data and change colors from the same chart, also tooltip is used to display a datapoint and year by mouse hovering over a coordinate, so that the viewer can read important data from annotations and trends to focus on important part in each scene.

### Scenes
Scene 1, Scene 2, and Scene 3 are created by year parameters with datapoints between 1960 and 1990, 1960 and 2010, and 1960 to 2021, respectively. The users can follow the order of scenes or select a scene that they might interest to read so that it would keep viewers from becoming disoriented.

### Annotations
Three scenes are followed for different annotations since they are filtered out by year parameters, because it can help the viewer to focus on different parts of the datapoints in each scene.

### Parameters
1990, 2010, and 2021 of years are used as parameters to filter out the datapoints to change states with loading a scene. Different year parameters cause to change the datapoints, colors, annotations to present different visualization in each scene.

### Triggers
My project provides callback function as a trigger to change a year parameter that change the state in each scene. when the button is clicked, a callback function will be called to change parameter values and then update the datapoints, colors, and annotations to change the visualization in each scene.
