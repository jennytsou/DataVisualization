	<h1>CS416 DATA VISUALIZATION - FINAL PROJECT</h1>
	<h2>by YUEH-CHEN TSOU</h2>
	<h2>Analysis of Population Age 0-14, 15-64, and 65 or over</h2>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Messaging:</span> Giving data of the global population ages 0-14, 15-64, and 65 or over from 1960 to 2021. 
			My project includes three scenes and a main page, totally. Year 1990, 2010, and 2021 as parameters are used to filter out the datapoints 
			to change states in each scene so that the users can investegate different visualization in each scene. </p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold"> Narrative Structure:</span> The narrative visualization is structured by an interactive slideshow. 
			Three scenes can be leaded by the main page into the narrative visualization, then the users can either follow the order of scenes or 
			select one of scenes that they might interest to read or investigate different visualization.</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Visual Structure:</span> The datapoints are filtered out by year parameters to change states that highlights important data 
			and change colors from the same chart, also tooltips are used to display a datapoint and year by mouse hovering over a coordinate, 
			so that the viewer can read important data from annotations and line charts to focus on important part in each scene.  </p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Scenes: </span> Scene 1, Scene 2, and Scene 3 are created by year parameters with datapoints 
			between 1960 and 1990, 1960 and 2010, and 1960 to 2021, respectively. The users can follow the order of scenes or select a scene that 
			they might interest to read so that it would keep viewers from becoming disoriented. </p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Annotations:</span> Three scenes are followed for different annotations since they are filtered out by year parameters, 
			so that it can help the viewer to focus on different parts of the datapoints in each scene.</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Parameters:</span> 1990, 2010, and 2021 of years are used as parameters to filter out the datapoints to change states with loading a scene.
			Different year parameters cause to change the datapoints, colors, annotations to present different visualization in each scene. </p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Triggers:</span> My project provides callback function as a trigger to change a year parameter that change the state in each scene.
			when the button is clicked, a callback function will be called to change parameter values and then update the datapoints, colors, and annotations to change 
			the visualization in each scene. </p>
